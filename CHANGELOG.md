# Changelog

## 0.1.2

- Kept Bifrost `/v1/models` as the inference-VK-filtered live inventory while enriching route metadata from Bifrost's own public datasheets.
- Added context/output/pricing discovery from `https://getbifrost.ai/datasheet` and reasoning/tool discovery from `https://getbifrost.ai/datasheet/model-parameters`.
- Corrected context semantics: `max_input_tokens` is used as the context/input ceiling when `context_length` is absent; it is not added to `max_output_tokens`.
- Provider-specific price-only rows now inherit missing limits from capability-complete rows for the same underlying model while retaining their own prices.
- Added narrowly scoped vendor-backed capability hints for fields Bifrost's public feeds currently omit, including GPT-5.6 image/reasoning capabilities and Xiaomi MiMo-V2.5 image/reasoning capabilities.
- Route members without authoritative context/output metadata are withheld instead of falling back to generic 128K/8K values.
- Kept provider-qualified route members distinct during alias synthesis, even when multiple providers serve the same underlying model ID.
- Added support for subscription `-free` entitlement aliases such as Laguna S 2.1 Free inheriting the underlying model's capability metadata.
- Added an integration check for the ten current OMP routing chains, plus public-datasheet coverage checks, unit tests, typechecking and the real OMP 18.0.4 plugin loader.

## 0.1.1

- Replaced the legacy `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` provider layer with OMP 18's native `pi.registerProvider(name, config)` API.
- Dynamic Bifrost discovery now uses OMP 18 `fetchDynamicModels` and canonical `thinking` metadata.
- Preserved separate Bifrost Bearer/API authentication and `x-bf-vk` inference governance.
- Changed bare Bifrost URL normalization to the live `/v1` mount.
- Added an OMP 18.0.4 plugin-loader validation step to CI so runtime extension import compatibility is tested directly.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Pifrost provider derived from `lxdlam/pi-bifrost-provider`.
- Dynamic Bifrost physical-model discovery over OpenAI Chat Completions.
- Conservative capability-envelope synthesis for Bifrost routing aliases.
- `/pifrost doctor` alias diagnostics.
- OMP-focused alias manifest and configuration documentation.
